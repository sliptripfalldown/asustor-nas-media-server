# fancontrol configuration for ASUSTOR Flashstor 6 (FS6706T)
#
# Fan curve based on CPU temperature:
#   - Below 40°C: 30% (quiet)
#   - 40-50°C: Linear ramp 30-60%
#   - 50-60°C: Linear ramp 60-80%
#   - Above 60°C: 100% (full speed)
#
# Install: sudo cp config/fancontrol/fancontrol.conf /etc/fancontrol
#          sudo systemctl enable --now fancontrol
#
# Note: hwmon paths may vary between boots. This config uses device paths
# which are more stable, but fancontrol resolves them at startup.

# Device paths (more stable than hwmon numbers)
# IT8625: /sys/devices/platform/asustor_it87.2608
# coretemp: /sys/devices/platform/coretemp.0

# Configuration format:
# INTERVAL: How often to check temps (seconds)
# DEVPATH: Maps hwmon device to stable path
# DEVNAME: Maps hwmon device to driver name
# FCTEMPS: Maps PWM to temperature sensor
# FCFANS: Maps PWM to fan tachometer
# MINTEMP: Temperature at which fan starts ramping
# MAXTEMP: Temperature at which fan hits maximum
# MINSTART: Minimum PWM to start fan spinning
# MINSTOP: Minimum PWM to keep fan spinning
# MINPWM: Minimum PWM value when ramping
# MAXPWM: Maximum PWM value
